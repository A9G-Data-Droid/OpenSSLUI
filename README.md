# OpenSSLUI 

I made this github repository because this project hadn't seen an update since 2014-04-21. The version found here was compiled using Visual Studio 2019.

## Installation Inscructions

As long as the OpenSSLUI.exe is in the same directory as openssl.exe itself, it will work.

    1. Install OpenSSL for Windows https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries
    2. Copy OpenSSLUI.exe in to the same directory as your OpenSSL binaries
    3. Run OpenSSLUI.exe

## Original Description

This project is intended to create a free Windows based UI for command line openssl operations. Currently a UI has been developed with Windows WPF. Existing code needs some code cleanups. The source and binaries are available for download.
